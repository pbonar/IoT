# IoT Final Project: Simple Neural Network Implementation

This project is part of the IoT curriculum for semester 3 and involves the implementation of a simple neural network. The project aims to demonstrate how neural networks can be integrated into IoT applications, providing insights into data processing and decision-making based on sensor inputs.

## Features

- **Neural Network Implementation**:
  - A basic feedforward neural network designed for pattern recognition tasks.
  - Training capabilities using sample data, with adjustable parameters (learning rate, epochs).
  - Evaluation of network performance on test datasets.

- **IoT Integration**:
  - Utilization of IoT devices (e.g., sensors) to collect data for training and inference.
  - Communication protocols for data exchange between devices and the neural network.
  - Visualization of results through a web interface or dashboard.
